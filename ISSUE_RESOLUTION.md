# Issue Resolution: SciPy Compilation Error

## 🐛 The Problem

When trying to install Python dependencies, you encountered this error:

```
error: subprocess-exited-with-error
× Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml) did not run successfully.
│ exit code: 1
```

The root cause was that **SciPy requires a Fortran compiler (gfortran)** to build from source, which wasn't installed on your macOS system.

## 🔍 Why This Happened

1. **SciPy Compilation**: SciPy is a scientific computing library that includes Fortran code
2. **Missing Fortran Compiler**: macOS doesn't come with gfortran by default
3. **Source Build**: The original `requirements.txt` specified exact versions that required compilation
4. **Python 3.13**: Newer Python versions sometimes have compatibility issues with older package versions

## ✅ The Solution

### Option 1: Simplified Requirements (Recommended)

I created `requirements-simple.txt` with:
- **Pre-compiled wheels**: Uses binary packages instead of source compilation
- **Flexible versions**: Uses `>=` instead of `==` for better compatibility
- **Essential packages only**: Focuses on core dependencies

### Option 2: Install Fortran Compiler

If you need the exact versions from the original requirements:

1. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools**:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. **Install gfortran**:
   ```bash
   brew install gcc
   ```

3. **Use original requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Current Status

✅ **RESOLVED**: The simplified requirements installed successfully
✅ **Local Server**: Running on http://localhost:3000
✅ **All Handlers**: Video, audio, emotion fusion, and dashboard working
✅ **Ready for AWS**: Can now proceed with AWS deployment

## 📋 What Was Fixed

1. **Dependencies**: All Python packages installed successfully
2. **Local Development**: Server runs without issues
3. **API Endpoints**: All endpoints responding correctly
4. **Deployment Script**: Updated to use simplified requirements

## 🎯 Next Steps

You can now proceed with AWS deployment:

```bash
# Configure AWS (if not done already)
aws configure

# Deploy to AWS
./scripts/deploy-aws-console.sh
```

## 💡 Prevention Tips

1. **Use Virtual Environments**: Always use `venv` to isolate dependencies
2. **Pre-compiled Wheels**: Prefer binary packages over source compilation
3. **Flexible Versions**: Use `>=` instead of `==` for better compatibility
4. **Test Locally**: Always test locally before deploying
